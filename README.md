# Self Driving Car

Self-driving cars are set to be the next revolution in the automotive industry. The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would, but the implementation is fraught with obstacles. You are tasked with creating a program that will allow a car to react to obstacles in the road.

To accomplish this, you’ll use your knowledge of TypeScript object types to apply types to a variety of classes, properties, and methods.

To create this program, we’re going to create a class named Car that we will make autonomous by adding typed properties and methods to it. By the end of the program, we’ll have a Car that can take control of steering and react to obstacles.
